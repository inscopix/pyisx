Overview
**********

The `pyisx <https://github.com/inscopix/pyisx>`_ project is a python binding for `isxcore <https://github.com/inscopix/isxcore>`_, a C++ API for interacting with Inscopix data.

Install
-------

The python package for this binding, named :code:`isx`, is available on `pypi <https://pypi.org/project/isx/>`_ for download.
To install :code:`isx`, run the following command in a python environment:

.. code-block:: python

   pip install isx

Please refer to the :ref:`installation` guide for more details.

File Types
----------

This package encapsulates the following I/O functionality:

* Reading Inscopix files (:code:`.isxd`, :code:`.isxb`, :code:`.gpio`, :code:`.imu`)
* Writing Inscopix files (:code:`.isxd`)
* Exporting Inscopix files to third-party formats (:code:`.mp4`, :code:`.tiff`, :code:`.csv`)

The following table summarizes all Inscopix file types and the functionality supported by this package:

      - :code:`.isxd`
      - Yes
      - Yes
      - :code:`.tiff`, :code:`.csv`
      - Vessels represented as a set of vessel diameter or red blood cell (rbc) velocity traces. A `Vessel Set` is generated from a blood flow `Microscope Movie`
    * - `GPIO`

      - Yes
      - No
      - :code:`.isxd`, :code:`.csv`
      - General purpose input/output signals recorded from an acquisition device
    * - `IMU`
      - :code:`.imu`
      - Yes
      - No
      - :code:`.isxd`, :code:`.csv`
      - Inertial measurement unit (accelerometer, magnetometer, orientationâ€‹) recorded from an acquisition device
    * - `Compressed Microscope Movie`
      - :code:`.isxc`
      - No
      - No
      - N/A
      - Compressed recording acquired from a microscope. A `Compressed Microscope Movie` is decompressed into a `Microscope Movie`
